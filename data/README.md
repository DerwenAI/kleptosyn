# Data

Download the required data from the following links:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerwenAI/senzing_starter_kit/refs/heads/main/senzing_rootfs/data/open-sanctions.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerwenAI/senzing_starter_kit/refs/heads/main/senzing_rootfs/data/open-ownership.json
```

This will create the following files in this directory:

- `open-sanctions.json`
- `open-ownership.json`

As a fallback strategy, the exported results from this use case in Senzing are avaiable
for download at [`export.json`](https://storage.googleapis.com/erkg/starterkit/export.json)


The `occrp_17k.csv` dataset comes from <https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-azerbaijani-laundromat/the-raw-data>
