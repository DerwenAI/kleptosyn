# KleptoSyn

Synthetic data generation for investigative graphs based on patterns
of bad-actor tradecraft.


## TODOs

  * Update the parameters of statistical models used for simulation and generating transfers
  * Leverage the BODS vocabulary <https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/rdf-vocabulary-for-the-beneficial-ownership-data-standard/> for Open Ownership data
  * Make better use of FtM vocabulary <https://discuss.opensanctions.org/t/wip-better-workflow-for-neo4j-data-conversion/64> for OpenSanctions data
  * How much inter-drain "scramble" occurs in the OCCRP data?
  * Refactor the `kleptosyn/sim.py` module to use Py abstract base classes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>

For the `demo.py` script:

  - have Clair and Prashanth eval to run ER + KG + algos to identify fraud
  - populate entity properties based on <https://github.com/senzing-garage/sz-graph-export/>
  - load network motif patterns representing bad-actor tradecraft
  - generate entities for shell corp intermediary organizations
     + located within tax-haven countries
     + apply _channel separation_ to obscure beneficial owners
     + use `name-dataset` and `random-address` to generate intermediares


## Approximated fraud rate

> estimated $3T/year in dark money flows.

> daily business-to-business (B2B) global payment volume is estimated
  at $328 billion, while the combined global business-to-consumer
  (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) market volume is just over $82
  billion per day.

> UK banks: transactions over £8,800 (€10,000) may be flagged for
  further checks.

> US banks: If you send payments valued at 10,000 USD or more, your
  bank or transfer provider will need to report these transfers to the
  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)

Combined annual B2B + B2B is approximately $150T/year, so the dark
money transfers are approximately 2% of total.


## Misc. requirements

  * We must describe the pathing and relations within graph data in flexible ways.
  * Formally speaking, these tradecraft patterns tend to be _walks_ or _circuits_.
  * Money transfers (event data) introduce stateful, temporal aspects to the graph.
  * Tradecraft motifs are not merely data queries, nor merely topological census.
  * Algebraic geometry, i.e., using an adjacency matrix, does not provide rich enough annotation.
  * We might adapt approaches from life sciences, e.g., _activity motifs_, albeit these are static.
  * We probably don't need to delve into the topological math as far as _cohomology_.


## Outstanding questions

**Q:** How should we represent network motifs?

  - Cypher paths subset in GraphFrames <https://github.com/Graphlet-AI/graphml-class/blob/main/graphml_class/stats/motif.py>
    + Seems ginormous and slow, with loads of dependencies?
    + GraphFrames has virtues, although we don't want to depend on this overall?
    + Could we use a pure Python Cypher parser instead?
      - Pypher <https://github.com/emehrkay/Pypher>
      - Pycypher <https://github.com/Mizzlr/pycypher>

  - Gremlin: a graph traversal language
    + programmatic definitions
    + <https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_features>
    + <https://pypi.org/project/gremlinpython/>

  - SNAP <https://snap-stanford.github.io/cs224w-notes/preliminaries/motifs-and-structral-roles_lecture>
    + RoIX and other methods seem more about identifying structural roles?

  - Mermaid syntax <https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html>
    + ER diagrams which work well for many schematic use cases.
    + Though perhaps not adaptable to network motifs?

  - Peregrin <https://github.com/pdclab/peregrine>
    + C++ framework

  - DSL in DotMotif <https://github.com/aplbrain/dotmotif/wiki/Getting-Started>
    + Lacks variable-length path representation?
    + Lacks metadata on either entities or relations?


**Q:** Motifs are static patterns; how can we model the stateful, temporal aspects of tradecraft?
  - Borrow techniques from speech recognition?
  - Wavelets, PDEs, or other time-series analysis

**Q:** Could topological methods provide useful formalisms for general descriptions?

  - _Sheaf theory_ -- from a problematic project, although widely cited for analysis


**Q:** Can we reuse _controlled vocabularies_ related to typical data sources and use cases?

## Process abstraction

Given a configuration of distributions for:
  - network size and shape
  - fraud kinds and rates

A high-level description of a process for generating synthetic graph
data is:

  1. Load entities for people
     - sample from distribution for inclusion in cliques
     - sample from distribution for channel seperation
     - sample from distribution for anomalies (false positives)
     - populate roles, beneficiary metadata, etc.
  2. Load entities for shell corp intermediary organizations.
     - sample from distribution for inclusion in cliques
  3. Load network motif patterns representing fraud tradecraft.
     - may be overlapping?
  4. Generate graph elements based on all of the above.
     - generate entities
     - generate network
     - generate transactions
  5. Serialize output
     - format: node-link, JSONL, Parquet, etc.
